**OpenCV implementation of background subtraction/foreground detection in Python**
===================

Background subtraction is a well-known technique for extracting the foreground objects in images
or videos. The main aim of background subtraction is to separate moving object foreground from
the background in a video, which makes the subsequent video processing tasks easier and more
efficient. Usually, the foreground object masks are obtained by performing a subtraction between
the current frame and a background model. The background model contains the characteristics of
the background or static part of a scene.
===================
This repo uses OpenCV to perform background subtraction to find the foreground object masks for 4 different scene conditions:

This repo uses OpenCV to perform background subtraction to find the foreground object masks for 4 different scene conditions : * Bullet list
* Nested bullet
                  * Sub-nested bullet etc
          * Bullet list item 2
